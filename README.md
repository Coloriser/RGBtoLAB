# 1 RGBtoLAB
Python Code for conversion of an image from RGB color model to LAB color model. 

The code accepts a JPG image in RGB color model as imput and converts it into a TIFF file in LAB color model.

###RGB
The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green and blue.Details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model).

###LAB
A Lab color space is a color-opponent space with dimensions L for lightness and a and b for the color-opponent dimensions, based on nonlinearly compressed (e.g. CIE XYZ) coordinates. Details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space).
 
###Usage
Supply the input image filename as a CLI. The converted image will be saved in the working directory.
